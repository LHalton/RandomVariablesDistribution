Introduction
========================================================

Link to application: 

This application presents the results of the distribution of random variables. The following distributions can be explored using this app:

- Normal
- Uniform
- t
- F
- Exponential
- Chi-square
- Log-normal  


User Inputs and Output
========================================================

The user selects certain inputs and then the output is a histogram based on the defined inputs. The user defined inputs include:  

- Distribution type
- Sample size
- Mean
- Standard Deviation  

There is also an option to show the density curve overlaying the histogram.  

Purpose
========================================================


The purpose of this application is to allow a user to visually explore the different kinds of distribution.  

Not only can different kinds of distributions be explored, but the user can understand how a distribution changes based on the sample size, mean, and standard deviation.  

This application can be a very useful tool for a student studying the different types of distribution.

Example
========================================================

The example that follows shows the output histogram when the inputs are defined as: 

- Distribution type: Normal
- Sample size: 300
- Mean: 0
- Standard Deviation: 2
